Create template of a card that has 0sections throws error
  im thinking add a message saying sorry you cant create a template with 0 sections unless we add some sort of savable config

Add success message after template created

Fix popup
  needs to be click twice once open to open
  doesnt fade away when done
  errors are linked :)

Application model, needs to foward a guest access token if user isnt logged in, as they may want to view the public cards
